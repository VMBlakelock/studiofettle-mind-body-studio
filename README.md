# Studiofettle Mind & Body Studio

## Aim 
To create a business website for a wellbeing studio - Studiofettle, that will showcase the health, fitness and wellbeing services on offer.



## Purpose
The proprietor of Studiofettle requires a website to use as an additional medium to the current social media page on the facebook platform. 

The website will be used as a marketing and advertising tool that will detail the services on offer at Studiofettle. 

In turn it is hoped this website will generate awareness not only of Studiofettle and its services, but also to promote the company philosophy that is 'the importance of taking time to look after oneself both in Mind and Body'.

It is hoped the website proves ROI, by more users viewing the site, clicking social media icons to the FB page, and completing the contact form to find out more.

## The 5 planes
### Strategy

The website is a business site to promote a real business with the aim to draw in new clients and promote events to current users.

It was to act as a secondary media to the popular social media page by showcasing the studio and its services.

The brand philosophy "working order" and "optimal state of wellbeing" was required to be a major part of the content.

During research it was found that there are many gyms/fitness centres in the local area, however their mantra's where to "get fit" "tone up" "work hard", therefore Studiofettle is unique in the fact that it is not a gym, it is a wellbeing studio that promotes health, fitness and a sense of wellbeing of the mind and the body.


### Scope

Project scope was based on simplicity. The design was to be 3 pages with a defined header and footer. 

Have a menu to navigate easily around the site. Provide a Call to Action by means of a contact form, to entice users to get in touch.

The users must have feedback that their message has been sent.


### Structure

The structure of the website was to be simple. The clients at Studiofettle are of various demographics (age, gender, life experiences) 

The 3 pages needed to replicate each other in the header and footer and house easy to view and read sections to accomodate all skill level. 

Navigation was to be easy and links minimal.


### Skeleton
#### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for Desktop and Mobile devices in the first instance as drawings and then recreated using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com).

The initial idea with the owner was to have a Home page, About/Meet the team page and a Contact Us page but during mockup it seemed more logical to have the 'About' section on the home page as in effect it was part of the buisness philosophy. 

Therefore it was decided the 'About' section was to be on the home page with the customer testimonials. The home page was renamed 'About Us'.

The 'Meet the team' page therefore displayed the portfolio of the proprieter and other services only. This page was also changes to 'Our Services'.


Studiofettle brand image was initially to be the focal point of the header section with the header in the centre, logo to the right and nav bar to the left. 

However there was an issue with the logo so the header design was changed to house only the navbar.

The company logo was finally placed in the centre of the image section on every page.


There were also some internal staffing changes during the development of this project and the proprietor requested we change the 'Meet the team' page to a 'Our Services' page instead. 

The Contact Us page mockup was created with a radio button, however after discussions it was agreed that a checkbox would be more beneficial if the user wanted to inquire about more than one service.

It was also decided to change the "Contact Us" page to "Join Us" as we felt it was less hard in its voice.


### Surface

Colors and fonts where important to the website to promote a calming, peaceful feel good reaction. 

Therefore the logo's "sandy" colors and the greys and blues of the studio decor where incorporated.

Users will see that Studiofettle is a reflective studio and will be able to move easily around the site to ascertain more.


## Features

- will house more professional images.
- will have an additional page presenting inspiring "success stories" from clients.

## Testing

Issue 1: 

It was found that I had built my project for desktop and not started it for Mobile First design. 

Therefore the webpage was not resposive to Iphone simulation in Google Dev Tools. 

Therefore I had to revisit the course module on Bootstrap grid to to gain better understanding.

Issue 2:

The navbar I just couldnt get right, although it worked I wasnt happy, it wasnt displaying as I liked. After reviewing the Bootstrap code again, I realised the code was incorrect.

Here I realised I had added continers and classes that where not required.
